### The rise of entertainment content
Using data collected in 2022 on Netflix's content, of which there are 5283 entries, it is noticeable that the number of movies and TV shows available in the past 5 years is much higher than any before then.

### Quantity over quality?
With so much more content being produced available over the past decade, we can compare the mean IMDB user ratings of content against the year of release. We can see an overall decrease in audience reception since 2000. As may be expected, in the early 2000s, these mean ratings are more varied, as there are fewer TV shows and films on Netflix from this time. Once we reach 2014 however, this flattens and the steady decrease in user ratings becomes more consistent.

### TV vs Film

Looking again at all content types, we can see that audience ratings for movies are more favourable than for TV shows.

### Does Age Certification affect a movie's IMDB rating?

Looking further into films, we can see that their mean rating remains between 6.3 and 7 across all age certifications. The normal distribution is greatest across G-rated movies, showing a much wider range IMDB ratings. R-rated movie's show the narrowest distribution, however, they have several outliers with a rating below 3.8.

### Conclusions

Netflix is continuing to add more recent content as it becomes available. With this increase in TV shows and films comes a downturn in audience reception. The perceived quality remains higher for films than it does for TV shows. The highest rated of the films are certified C and PG, with the highest mean certified NC-17. Further research could be done with additional production information such as genre, country of origin.
