### Quantity over quality?
Using data collected in 2022 on Netflix's content, of which there are 5283 entries, it is noticeable that the number of movies and TV shows available in the past 5 years is much higher than any before then.

### Quantity over quality?
With so much more content being produced available over the past decade, we can compare the mean IMDB user ratings of content against the year of release. We can see an overall decrease in audience reception since 2000. As may be expected, in the early 2000s, these mean ratings are more varied, as there are fewer TV shows and films on Netflix from this time. Once we reach 2014 however, this flattens and the steady decrease in user ratings becomes more consistent.
